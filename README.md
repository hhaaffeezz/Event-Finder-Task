# Event-Finder-Task
Task for the dynamic 360 
This project is a responsive React-based user interface that includes a navigation bar, a hero section, a featured events area with a dynamic search bar, and a footer. The featured events section incorporates a slider and displays event cards that are dynamically populated by fetching data from a local db.json file using async/await.

The search functionality allows users to filter events by name or location in real time, utilizing JavaScriptâ€™s .filter() method for efficient client-side filtering.
